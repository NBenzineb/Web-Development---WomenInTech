  <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;" >WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>WomenInTech is an organisation that aims to educate, up-skill, and promote equality within the technology sector. Whether you are a new programmer or a start-up requiring technical consulting, we want to help.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p >Females aren’t considering technology careers as they aren’t given enough information on what working in the sector involves and also because no one is putting it forward as an option to them.
  A lack of female role models is also reinforcing the perception that a technology career isn’t for them. Only 22% of students can name a famous female working in technology. Whereas two thirds can name a famous man working in technology.The statistics demonstrate that there are still not enough women in tech despite the fact that there are more opportunities for women to delve into tech now. It is still primarily seen as a male dominated industry and we are here to help change that and shape the future for the women in tech. One of the main reasons why there are not enough women in tech is due to the lack of awareness and understanding around tech.

   <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">DIVERSITY</h3>
    <p>There are also a lack of women from BAME (Black, asian, minority ethnic) backgrounds in the tech industry with statistics showing that BAME’s make up for 18% of the tech industry, only increasing by 2% from 2015. In 2019, only an average of 9% of BAME IT specialists were director level. Therefore, we especially encourage women from BAME backgrounds to explore a career in tech as more diversity is needed in tech. 
      </p>
      <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WORKING IN TECH</h3>
    <p>There is often a misconception that to work in tech, you need a STEM degree or that you need to know how to code to a high level and know CSS, Javascript, python and more to be successful for a career in tech. However, anyone with transferable and relevant skills can apply for a job in tech, from working in project management to someone working as a front end developer. Therefore, we are here to help guide you through the different routes available for a career in tech and to encourage you to actively consider a career in tech whether you are already a STEM graduate, arts/social sciences graduate, a professional or simply just want to explore a new career.

      As you can see 1/6 tech specialists are women in the UK and only 1/10 of the leaders are women. In 2020, there was only 24% women in STEM which includes tech. This shows that there are still not enough women in tech despite the focus towards women in STEM in the last decade. ‘When looking into secondary data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) Labour Force Survey, BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, found in 2019 that the 249,000 women working in UK technology accounted for 17% of IT specialists in the region, a figure which has only grown by 1% over the past five years’.

     This demonstrates that there are many tech vacancies but that more work needs to be done to increase the number of BAME’s, women in tech.
